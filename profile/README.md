# openGrid - Your 3D printed desk/wall mounting framework and ecosystem

Welcome to openGrid! openGrid is meant to be an open and extendible wall/desk mounting framework. It's core parts are relased using the CC-BY license and allow you to freely change and grow your own solutions based on openGrid.

For now this is still in an early stage, so not much to see here. But you can start download and print the openGrid files:

* [openGrid on Printables](https://www.printables.com/@DavidD/collections/2174464)
* [openGrid on Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/collections/5283101-opengrid)

You may also find additonal openGrid models by searching for "openGrid" on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/search/models?q=openGrid) or [Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/search/models?keyword=openGrid).

openGrid provides the following benefits compared to other systems:
* Opinionated design, focus on **easy usage**
* Full **"living room compatibility"** (aka wife/husband approved design)
* **Lite board** for less demanding usages
* Build upon **open standards like Multiconnect**
* **Grindinity compatibility**
* Optimised **Underware** flavour for reduces filament usage
* Integrates **Multiboard, HSW and GOEWS**
* Open license, open mindset, **open ecosystem** (guaranteed borg-free, no assimilation of your models)

In additional to the official openGrid files you may use those generators to create models matching the openGrid 28mm grid size (thanks to the Multiconnect connector system, *you need to change the grid size to 28mm*):
* [Multiconnect Part Generator - Master Collection](https://makerworld.com/en/models/582260-multiconnect-part-generator-master-collection#profileId-633542)
* [Underwarwe 2.0](https://makerworld.com/en/models/783010-underware-2-0-infinite-cable-management#profileId-808979) - Although the recommendation would be to use the [openGrid Underware flavour](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1175037-underware-for-opengrid#profileId-1195039)

Happy printing!
